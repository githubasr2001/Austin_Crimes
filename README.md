# Austin Crime Data Analysis: Insights and Predictive Analytics

I'm excited to share my recent project analyzing Austin's crime data, where I built an interactive dashboard and predictive model to uncover patterns in criminal activity across the city.

## Project Overview

Using Python and a suite of data science tools, I developed a comprehensive crime analytics platform that transforms raw incident data into actionable intelligence. The dashboard provides law enforcement and community stakeholders with:

- Real-time visualization of crime patterns by location, time, and offense type
- Predictive modeling to forecast case clearance probability
- Spatial analysis to identify high-risk areas
- Temporal trend analysis showing crime fluctuations by hour, day, and month

## Key Findings

üìä **Temporal Patterns**: Identified peak crime hours and days, enabling optimized patrol scheduling

üó∫Ô∏è **Spatial Distribution**: Mapped crime hotspots across council districts and location types, revealing significant disparities in criminal activity

üîç **Offense Analysis**: Categorized and visualized predominant crime types, supporting targeted prevention strategies

‚öñÔ∏è **Clearance Insights**: Built a Random Forest classifier achieving strong prediction accuracy for case resolution likelihood

## Technologies Used

- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest Classifier with feature importance analysis
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit with custom CSS styling
- **Geospatial Analysis**: MapBox integration for crime mapping

## Impact

This project demonstrates how data science can support evidence-based policing strategies and community safety initiatives. The interactive dashboard allows stakeholders to:

- Filter data dynamically by date, offense type, district, and clearance status
- Generate downloadable reports for different analytical perspectives
- Identify key factors influencing crime clearance rates
- Visualize family violence incidents and distribution patterns

## Future Directions

I plan to enhance this project by incorporating demographic data, socioeconomic indicators, and additional time-series forecasting to provide deeper insights into crime causality and prevention opportunities.
